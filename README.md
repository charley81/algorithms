# Algorithms 

> In the start of this repo I have basic knowledge of algorithms. I've worked though some basic problems using the repl.it learning platform. I have a very basic knowledge in math and made it to algebra 1 in school. I'm looking forward to enhancing my problem solving skills but know I have a long road ahead. Too Easy!

## What I hope to learn from computer science
- Better problem solving skills
- Become a better developer
- Increase my chances of finding a developer job
- Keep my mind sharp with daily problems to solve


## What I learned while studying computer science
> More to come
